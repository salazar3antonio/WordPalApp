# WordPal
WordPal is an Android game I created to improve one's vocabulary by taking word quizzes.

## Game
- There are levels of difficulty ranging from elementary to GMAT level. 
- Each category has difficulty levels the player can unlock. 
- Bonus points are given to quick and correct answers. 
- Click and hold a word to bring up its definition.
- See if you can collect all the stars! 

## Development
- WordPal fetches quizzes and word definitions using a RESTful API from www.twinword.com. 
- RetroFit was implemented to efficiently make calls to the API. 
- WordPal also saves the user's favorited words and report cards in a persistent database using MySQL. 
- Mobile and Tablet versions are supported with appropriate resource layouts. 
- Ads were added to the free version by adding the Google Services Ads dependencies 

## Design
- WorldPal uses bold colors and fun iconography to make it an inviting game for all to enjoy. 
- I added user interface elements to align with Google's Material Design principles 
- A custom logo and Google Play Store imagery were created to give the app a cohesive brand identity
